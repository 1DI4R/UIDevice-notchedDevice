# UIDevice+notchedDevice
Easily get if your iDevice is notched or not

How to use this? it's really simple
Copy paste these two files to your project, add the `.m` file to your `Makefile` and don't forget to include the `.h` file and then
Just use these:
```objective-c
[UIDevice.currentDevice isNotched]; //This will return a BOOL that is equal to YES if the device is notched
[UIDevice.currentDevice isAniPad]; //This will return a BOOL that is equal to YES if the device is an iPad
[UIDevice.currentDevice isAniPod]; //This will return a BOOL that is equal to YES if the device is an iPod
```
You can use those like this :
BOOL isNotchedDevice = [UIDevice.currentDevice isNotched];

This is pretty useless but you know
